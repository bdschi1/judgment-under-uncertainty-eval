# Module 01: Equity Thesis Construction

## Status: Planned

## Core Idea

This module evaluates whether an AI can construct and critique investment theses that distinguish between:

- Variant perception vs. consensus view
- Structural alpha vs. environmental tailwind
- Falsifiable thesis components vs. unfalsifiable narrative
- Time-appropriate thesis framing (catalyst-driven vs. compounder)

## Key Concepts to Test

### Thesis Quality Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Tests |
|-----------|---------------|
| Variant identification | Can the model identify what's different about this view? |
| Falsifiability | Are there clear conditions that would invalidate the thesis? |
| Time horizon alignment | Does thesis structure match expected realization? |
| Risk acknowledgment | Are the ways to be wrong explicitly identified? |

### Healthcare-Specific Thesis Types

- Clinical-stage biotech: Binary catalyst thesis
- Large-cap pharma: Pipeline optionality + capital return
- MedTech: Procedure volume thesis + pricing power
- Healthcare services: Utilization + margin expansion
- Life sciences tools: R&D cycle thesis

## Planned Scenarios

1. **Biotech catalyst thesis** — Distinguish between "good drug" thesis vs. "good setup" thesis
2. **Pharma pipeline optionality** — Value embedded optionality without overcapitalizing hope
3. **MedTech competitive moat** — Identify durable vs. temporary advantages
4. **Healthcare services regulatory thesis** — Separate policy view from company fundamentals
5. **GARP vs. deep value** — Match thesis structure to situation

## Common Failure Modes

- `narrative_seduction`: Thesis sounds good but lacks falsifiability
- `environmental_attribution`: Crediting company for sector/market tailwinds
- `thesis_drift`: Starting with one thesis, ending with another
- `conviction_without_variant`: Strong view without identified edge

## Grading Approach

Uses universal rubric adapted for thesis quality:

1. **Variant clarity**: Is the differentiated view explicit?
2. **Falsifiability**: Are invalidation conditions clear?
3. **Risk treatment**: Are ways to be wrong acknowledged?
4. **Critical error**: Unfalsifiable narrative presented as rigorous thesis
