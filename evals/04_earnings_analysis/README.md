# Module 04: Earnings Analysis

## Status: Planned

## Core Idea

This module evaluates whether an AI can analyze earnings releases and guidance that:

- Separates signal from noise in quarterly results
- Evaluates management credibility and incentives
- Identifies thesis-relevant information vs. headline numbers
- Recognizes when "beats" or "misses" are meaningful

## Key Concepts to Test

### Earnings Judgment Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Tests |
|-----------|---------------|
| Signal vs. noise | Is the quarter thesis-relevant? |
| Management credibility | Can guidance be trusted? |
| Estimate quality | Are consensus expectations reasonable? |
| Reaction appropriateness | Is the market response proportionate? |

### Healthcare-Specific Earnings Challenges

- **Biotech burn rate** — Cash runway implications
- **Pharma segment** — Product-level performance vs. consolidated
- **MedTech seasonality** — Procedure volume timing
- **Healthcare services** — MLR normalization, membership growth
- **One-time adjustments** — "Non-recurring" items that recur

## Planned Scenarios

1. **Beat/miss interpretation** — When 2% miss matters, when 5% beat doesn't
2. **Guidance credibility** — Evaluating management projections
3. **Segment analysis** — Important trends masked by consolidation
4. **Cash flow quality** — Earnings vs. cash generation divergence
5. **Estimate revision** — When to update thesis vs. trim noise

## Common Failure Modes

- `headline_anchoring`: Overweighting beat/miss vs. thesis relevance
- `management_trust`: Accepting guidance without credibility assessment
- `recency_bias`: Overweighting this quarter vs. pattern
- `noise_amplification`: Treating volatility as signal

## Grading Approach

Uses universal rubric adapted for earnings analysis:

1. **Signal identification**: What's thesis-relevant?
2. **Credibility assessment**: Can sources be trusted?
3. **Reaction framing**: Is response proportionate?
4. **Critical error**: Changing thesis based on noise
