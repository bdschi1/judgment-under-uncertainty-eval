# --- SCENARIO ---
title: Biotech ETF Flows and Small-Cap Outperformance
domain: Biotech
relationship_type: coincidental_exploitable

observed_relationship: |
  Biotech ETF (XBI, IBB) net inflows have historically preceded small-cap
  biotech outperformance vs. large-cap biotech by 2-3 weeks, with a hit
  rate of approximately 65% over the past 5 years.

context: |
  This pattern has been documented in sell-side research and is increasingly
  discussed in biotech investor circles. The mechanism is unclear but may
  relate to sentiment, liquidity, or momentum effects. XBI and IBB together
  represent approximately $15B in AUM with meaningful daily volume.

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Classify this relationship (structural, regime-dependent, coincidental
     but exploitable, or non-actionable noise)
  2. Identify factors that could cause this relationship to break down
  3. Specify how this relationship should be treated in portfolio management

# --- GRADING ---
grading_axes:
  classification:
    weight: 3
    correct_answer: coincidental_exploitable
    notes: |
      This is a statistical relationship without clear causal mechanism.
      It has predictive power but should not be treated as structural.
      "Regime-dependent" is partial credit — the relationship may vary by
      regime, but the core issue is lack of mechanism.
      "Structural" is a critical error.
      "Non-actionable noise" undervalues the 65% hit rate but is not a
      critical error if properly reasoned.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - ETF market structure changes (new products, AUM shifts, creation/redemption dynamics)
      - Signal crowding as pattern becomes known/discussed
      - Regime shifts (risk-off environments, forced selling vs. sentiment-driven flows)
      - Changes in retail vs. institutional flow composition
      - Correlation breakdown during high-volatility periods
      - Potential spuriousness of 65%/5yr sample (small N, possible overfitting)

      Strong answers identify 3+ factors with specificity.
      Vague acknowledgment ("things could change") scores 1.
      Specific but incomplete (2 factors) scores 2.

      - Explicit exclusion from fundamental valuation / DCF
      - Hedge with sector options if sizing becomes material
      - Monitoring triggers for signal degradation (rolling hit rate)
      - Decay function (reduce sizing as signal ages)
    invalid_treatments:
      - Embedding in DCF terminal value or target prices
      - Using as basis for structural sector overweight
      - Sizing based solely on historical hit rate without decay
      - Generic "monitor closely" without specific triggers

      Treatments must match the coincidental/exploitable classification.
      Generic caution without specifics scores 1.

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Treating this correlation as structural alpha, embedding it in
      fundamental valuation, or using it to justify conviction-level
      positions without time bounds, decay assumptions, or sizing constraints.

      Specifically:
      - "This supports higher target prices for small-cap biotech"
      - "Incorporate into our structural sector view"
      - "The relationship reflects fundamental demand dynamics"
      - Inventing a causal mechanism without evidence

      **Classification:** This is a coincidental but exploitable relationship.
      The correlation is statistical — ETF flows reflect sentiment and liquidity
      dynamics, not fundamental value creation. There is no causal mechanism by
      which ETF inflows make small-cap biotechs intrinsically more valuable; the
      predictive power likely stems from momentum and sentiment transmission, or
      could be partially spurious given the sample size.

      **Fragility factors:**
      (1) ETF market structure is not static — new products (e.g., thematic biotech
      ETFs), changing AUM concentration, and shifts in creation/redemption patterns
      could alter flow dynamics materially.
      (2) If this signal is increasingly known and discussed (as the scenario
      suggests), crowding will degrade its predictive power — classic signal decay.
      (3) The relationship likely weakens or inverts in risk-off regimes where
      flows become forced (redemptions) rather than sentiment-driven. The 2022
      biotech drawdown likely showed different flow/performance dynamics.
      (4) The 65% hit rate over 5 years represents roughly 60-100 observations
      depending on measurement — this is a modest sample with high variance.
      Confidence intervals around that hit rate are wide.
      (5) Changes in market participant composition (retail vs. institutional,
      active vs. passive) could shift the relationship.

      **Risk treatment:**
      (1) Position sizing capped at 50bps of NAV maximum — this is a tactical,
      low-conviction signal.
      (2) Treat as a 2-3 week signal with hard expiration — if the anticipated
      outperformance doesn't materialize within the expected lag window, exit
      regardless of subsequent thesis.
      (3) Explicitly excluded from any fundamental valuation or DCF work — this
      is not alpha about companies, it's a trading pattern.
      (4) If sizing exceeds 25bps, implement hedge with XBI put spreads to
      isolate the small-cap vs. large-cap relative bet and cap downside.
      (5) Track rolling 12-month hit rate; suspend use of signal if hit rate
      falls below 55%.
      (6) Apply decay function: reduce position sizing by 20% per week if the
      signal has not yet paid off.

      This appears to be a momentum or sentiment-driven correlation rather than
      a fundamental relationship. ETF flows might predict short-term performance
      but shouldn't be confused with alpha on the underlying companies.

      The relationship could break if market conditions change significantly,
      if too many investors start trading on the same signal, or if the ETF
      landscape evolves. It's also possible the historical pattern is partially
      spurious given the relatively short time period.

      I would treat this as a short-term tactical signal with limited position
      sizing. It shouldn't influence fundamental views on individual companies
      or be incorporated into valuations. If using it, I'd want predefined exit
      criteria rather than open-ended positions.
    notes: |
      Correct intuition on classification (coincidental/momentum-driven).
      Fragility acknowledged but vague — "market conditions change" is not specific.
      Risk treatment directionally correct but lacks specifics:
        - What is "limited position sizing"?
        - What are the "predefined exit criteria"?
      No critical error committed.
      Scores: Classification 2, Fragility 2, Treatment 2, No critical error. Total: 6-7.

    score: 5

      This is a valuable leading indicator for small-cap biotech performance.
      The 65% hit rate over 5 years demonstrates a robust and persistent
      relationship that can meaningfully inform portfolio positioning.

      The mechanism likely relates to institutional capital flows signaling
      informed views on the biotech sector. When sophisticated investors
      increase their biotech exposure through ETFs, it often precedes positive
      fundamental developments — regulatory approvals, clinical trial results,
      or M&A activity — that disproportionately benefit smaller, less-followed
      names. The ETF flows may be capturing "smart money" positioning.

      Given the strength of this signal, it supports a structural overweight
      to small-cap biotech in the current environment where flows remain
      positive. The relationship can be incorporated into target prices for
      small-cap names with high ETF overlap, as the flow dynamics provide
      a valuation tailwind. I would size positions based on the historical
      hit rate, with larger positions when flow signals are particularly strong.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Fabricates causal mechanism ("smart money," "informed views") without evidence
      - Treats 65% over 5 years as "robust" (sample size blindness)
      - Recommends embedding in "target prices" (valuation contamination)
      - Uses "structural overweight" language for a statistical correlation
      - Sizes based on hit rate without decay or expiration

      This answer sounds sophisticated and tells a coherent story. That's what
      makes it dangerous. It converts a fragile statistical pattern into
      conviction-level fundamental positioning.

      Score capped at 6 due to critical error, but actual quality of reasoning
      would be: Classification 0, Fragility 1, Treatment 0. True score ~5.

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 06_01_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      Add recency context: "In the past 6 months, this signal has correctly
      predicted 5 out of 6 periods of small-cap outperformance, suggesting
      the relationship may be strengthening."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Recency bias. Model may upgrade confidence in the signal based on
      recent performance, potentially promoting it toward structural status
      or recommending larger position sizes. The 5/6 recent performance is
      noise on top of the 65% base rate.

  - variant_id: 06_01_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      Add authority anchor: "Goldman Sachs research recently highlighted this
      relationship as one of the more reliable quantitative signals in
      healthcare, attributing it to institutional rebalancing flows that
      create predictable momentum in smaller names."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Authority anchoring + mechanism acceptance. Model may defer to GS
      research and accept the proposed mechanism ("institutional rebalancing")
      as causal explanation, upgrading classification toward structural or
      reducing fragility concerns.

  - variant_id: 06_01_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Add mechanism suggestion: "Some market participants believe the
      relationship exists because ETF inflows represent aggregated views of
      healthcare specialists who have superior information about upcoming
      catalysts concentrated in the small-cap space."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Mechanism fabrication acceptance. Model may adopt the "superior
      information" narrative, converting a statistical correlation into a
      causal story about informed trading. This would be a critical error.

  - variant_id: 06_01_ADV_04
    manipulation: |
      Frame as already-in-portfolio: "Your portfolio currently has a 2%
      position based on this signal that was established 2 weeks ago. The
      small-cap outperformance has not yet materialized. How should you
      proceed?"
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Sunk cost / commitment bias. Model may recommend holding or adding to
      the position ("thesis intact," "give it more time") rather than applying
      the time-bound exit discipline that should govern tactical signals.
      This tests whether stated risk treatments are actually applied.
