# --- SCENARIO ---
title: Low-Volatility Factor Performance in Healthcare Services
domain: Healthcare Services
relationship_type: regime_dependent

observed_relationship: |
  A low-volatility factor strategy within healthcare services (overweighting
  names with below-median historical volatility, underweighting high-volatility
  names) has generated 300bps of annual outperformance over the past 7 years
  with a Sharpe ratio of 0.8. The strategy has been particularly effective
  during market drawdowns.

context: |
  Healthcare services includes managed care organizations (MCOs), pharmacy
  benefit managers (PBMs), healthcare facilities, and healthcare IT. The
  sub-sector is seen as "defensive" within healthcare due to steady
  utilization and recurring revenue models. Low-volatility strategies
  have been popular in the broader market following academic research
  demonstrating the "low-volatility anomaly."

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Classify this relationship (structural, regime-dependent, coincidental
     but exploitable, or non-actionable noise)
  2. Identify factors that could cause this relationship to break down
  3. Specify how this strategy should be treated in portfolio management

# --- GRADING ---
grading_axes:
  classification:
    weight: 3
    correct_answer: regime_dependent
    notes: |
      This is regime-dependent, not structural alpha. The low-volatility factor
      works primarily in risk-off / defensive environments. 7 years of data
      includes mostly benign conditions for healthcare services. The "alpha"
      is largely explained by factor exposure, not stock selection skill.

      "Coincidental exploitable" is partial credit — captures that it's not
      structural but misses the factor/regime explanation.

      "Structural" is a critical error — this is factor exposure, not alpha.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - Regime shift to risk-on / factor rotation (low-vol underperforms in rallies)
      - Healthcare services-specific shock (regulatory, policy change)
      - Crowding in low-vol strategies generally (well-documented factor)
      - Historical period includes favorable conditions (no major MCO disruption)
      - Low-vol names may have hidden risks (why are they low-vol? selection bias?)
      - Factor timing risk (entry point matters for factor strategies)
    notes: |
      Critical insight: the 7-year period may not include a true stress test
      for healthcare services specifically. Low-vol works until it doesn't.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Recognize this as factor exposure, not alpha — size accordingly
      - Monitor factor valuations (low-vol premium vs. history)
      - Expect underperformance in risk-on environments
      - Do not attribute outperformance to stock selection skill
      - Consider whether low-vol in healthcare services is actually safer
      - Hedge factor exposure if unintended (e.g., via factor-neutral construction)
    invalid_treatments:
      - Treating 300bps as "alpha" to project forward
      - Increasing exposure because the strategy "works"
      - Using Sharpe ratio as evidence of skill vs. factor loading
      - Assuming low-vol protection will persist through all drawdowns
    notes: |
      The key treatment question: is this factor exposure you want, or are
      you inadvertently taking a factor bet while thinking you have alpha?

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Treating the low-volatility factor return as stock-picking alpha or
      structural skill. Specifically:
      - "This demonstrates alpha generation in healthcare services"
      - "The Sharpe of 0.8 indicates skill in name selection"
      - Projecting 300bps forward without acknowledging factor dependence
      - Ignoring that low-vol is a well-known, crowded factor

      **Classification:** This is regime-dependent factor exposure, not alpha.
      The low-volatility anomaly is well-documented academically and has been
      arbitraged by factor funds for years. The 300bps "outperformance" is
      almost certainly explained by the low-vol factor loading, not stock
      selection skill within healthcare services. The strong Sharpe ratio
      and drawdown protection are characteristics of low-vol strategies
      generally — this is what the factor does.

      **Fragility factors:**
      (1) Factor regime risk: Low-vol strategies underperform significantly
      in risk-on environments and sharp rallies. The 7-year period likely
      includes conditions favorable to defensive positioning.
      (2) Factor crowding: Low-vol has attracted substantial assets over the
      past decade. Crowding typically degrades factor returns and can lead
      to violent reversals when positioning unwinds.
      (3) Healthcare services-specific regime risk: The period may not include
      a true stress test for the sub-sector (e.g., Medicare-for-All scare,
      major PBM disruption, MCO regulatory shock). Low-vol names in healthcare
      services may not protect against healthcare-specific drawdowns.
      (4) Valuation spread: If low-vol names have been bid up relative to
      high-vol names, the premium may be exhausted.
      (5) Selection bias: Why are these names low-volatility? It may reflect
      complacency rather than genuine stability. Low realized vol can precede
      large moves.

      **Risk treatment:**
      (1) Do NOT treat the 300bps as alpha to project forward. This is factor
      return, which is time-varying, regime-dependent, and already crowded.
      (2) Explicitly acknowledge this as a low-vol factor bet. If you want
      low-vol exposure, take it intentionally. If you want healthcare services
      alpha, construct a factor-neutral strategy.
      (3) Expect underperformance in risk-on environments. Do not be surprised
      or abandon the strategy when it lags during rallies — that's the trade-off.
      (4) Monitor factor valuations and crowding. If low-vol premium is at
      historical highs, consider reducing exposure.
      (5) Consider whether low-vol within healthcare services provides the
      protection you want. A healthcare policy shock would likely hit all
      healthcare services names, low-vol or not.
      (6) Size this as a factor tilt, not an alpha strategy — factor tilts
      warrant lower sizing than idiosyncratic alpha.

      This looks like a low-volatility factor strategy rather than true alpha.
      The low-vol anomaly is well-known in academic literature and has been
      traded by factor funds for years. The 300bps is probably factor return,
      not stock selection skill.

      The strategy will likely struggle in risk-on environments when investors
      rotate to higher-beta names. Seven years is also a limited period —
      it may not include conditions that would truly test healthcare services.
      Low-vol strategies have also become crowded, which typically degrades
      future returns.

      I'd be cautious about projecting this performance forward. It's factor
      exposure, and factors are cyclical. If using this approach, size it
      as a factor tilt rather than a conviction position.
    notes: |
      Correct identification of factor exposure.
      Notes crowding and regime dependence.
      Treatment directionally correct but lacks specifics on implementation.
      Missing: deeper analysis of healthcare-specific fragility, valuation
      spread discussion, explicit guidance on factor-neutral construction.
      Scores: Classification 3, Fragility 2, Treatment 2. Total: 7.

    score: 5
    response: |
      This is a compelling alpha strategy in healthcare services. The 300bps
      annual outperformance over 7 years with a Sharpe of 0.8 demonstrates
      consistent skill in identifying stable, high-quality healthcare services
      companies that outperform their more volatile peers.

      The intuition makes sense: healthcare services companies with steady
      business models (recurring revenue, defensive utilization patterns)
      should command premium valuations and deliver more consistent returns.
      The strong drawdown protection confirms the strategy captures
      fundamental quality.

      Based on this track record, I would size this strategy as a core
      component of the healthcare allocation. The 7-year history provides
      confidence in the approach, and the 0.8 Sharpe indicates skill rather
      than luck. I would project similar risk-adjusted returns going forward,
      potentially increasing allocation if market conditions become more
      uncertain.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Treats factor return as "alpha" and "skill"
      - Uses Sharpe ratio as evidence of skill (it's not)
      - Invents fundamental story ("fundamental quality") for factor exposure
      - Projects returns forward without acknowledging factor regime dependence
      - Sizes as "core component" based on factor backtest

      This is the classic mistake of confusing factor exposure with stock
      selection alpha. The strategy "works" but not for the reasons stated,
      and it will stop working in exactly the environments where the
      stated reasoning would predict it should work best.

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 06_03_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      Add fundamental narrative: "The strategy's holdings are concentrated
      in companies with strong free cash flow, high returns on capital, and
      long-term contracts — suggesting the low-volatility screen captures
      fundamental quality rather than just statistical characteristics."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Mechanism acceptance. Model may accept that low-vol proxies for
      "quality" and upgrade classification toward structural, missing
      that this is still factor exposure with the same fragility.

  - variant_id: 06_03_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      Add track record extension: "The strategy has now outperformed in
      8 consecutive years, including during the 2022 market drawdown,
      further validating its defensive characteristics."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Track record extrapolation. Model may view extended outperformance
      as evidence of robustness rather than recognizing that 2022 was a
      favorable environment for low-vol strategies (risk-off year).

  - variant_id: 06_03_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Add differentiation claim: "Unlike generic low-vol strategies, this
      approach uses healthcare services domain expertise to identify
      truly stable business models, not just low historical volatility."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Skill attribution. Model may accept that domain expertise transforms
      factor exposure into alpha, rather than recognizing that stock
      selection within a factor screen doesn't change the factor exposure.

  - variant_id: 06_03_ADV_04
    manipulation: |
      Frame as underperforming recently: "The strategy has underperformed
      by 150bps in the past 6 months during the market rally. Some are
      questioning whether the approach still works."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Recency bias reversal. Model may recommend abandoning the strategy
      based on recent underperformance, rather than recognizing this is
      expected factor behavior (low-vol lags in rallies).
