# --- SCENARIO ---
title: FDA PDUFA Binary Outcome Probability for Oncology NDA
domain: Biotech
relationship_type: regime_dependent

observed_relationship: |
  A mid-cap biotech ($4B market cap) has a Phase 3 oncology drug approaching
  its PDUFA date. The pivotal trial met its primary overall survival (OS)
  endpoint with HR=0.72 (p<0.001). The FDA Advisory Committee (Adcom) voted
  9-4 in favor of approval. The historical base rate for FDA approval of
  oncology drugs that meet their primary OS endpoint is approximately 85%.
  Options-implied probability of approval is approximately 70%.

context: |
  The FDA has recently tightened scrutiny on novel oncology agents, particularly
  around durability of response and long-term safety data. A Complete Response
  Letter (CRL) was issued for a peer company's bispecific antibody in a related
  indication two months ago, citing insufficient long-term follow-up despite
  positive efficacy data. The drug under review uses a similar mechanism of
  action (bispecific antibody) but targets a different tumor type. The company
  has no other marketed products and has guided $400M in pre-launch inventory
  build. Sell-side consensus assigns 80-90% approval probability. The stock
  trades at $45 versus a Street target of $72 (approval) / $18 (rejection).

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Estimate the probability of FDA approval, expressing a range rather
     than a point estimate
  2. Identify the key base rates and explain how current conditions adjust them
  3. Assess whether the options-implied 70% or the sell-side 80-90% better
     reflects the true probability
  4. Describe how your probability estimate should influence position sizing

    correct_answer: regime_dependent
    notes: |
      FDA approval probability is regime-dependent: historical base rates
      provide a starting point, but the current regulatory environment
      (tightened scrutiny, peer CRL) creates a regime shift that should
      adjust the base rate downward. The 85% historical base rate is the
      anchor, but current conditions justify a lower estimate.

      Treating the 85% base rate as immutable is a critical error.
      Treating the options-implied 70% as the answer without independent
      analysis is market-price anchoring.
      Ignoring the base rate entirely and estimating from scratch is
      base-rate neglect.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - FDA regulatory regime shift (tightened scrutiny, peer CRL for similar MOA)
      - Adcom vote is advisory only — FDA disagrees with Adcom ~20% of the time
      - Peer CRL creates precedent concern even with different tumor type
      - Long-term safety/durability data adequacy is subjective FDA judgment
      - Company has no other products (single-asset risk amplifies binary outcome)
      - Pre-launch inventory build signals company confidence but is not evidence
      - Sell-side conflict of interest (banking relationships inflate estimates)
      - Options market may reflect hedging demand, not pure probability
    notes: |
      Strong answers identify that the 85% base rate, 9-4 Adcom vote, and
      peer CRL each provide information that must be integrated, not
      cherry-picked. The peer CRL is the key regime-shift factor.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Position size calibrated to probability range, not point estimate
      - Kelly criterion or fractional Kelly based on probability and payoff asymmetry
      - Express view through options (defined risk) rather than equity alone
      - Size for survival — max loss must be tolerable at rejection scenario ($18)
      - Avoid binary bet sizing — this is a probability, not a certainty
      - Diversify catalyst exposure across multiple PDUFA dates
    invalid_treatments:
      - Full conviction position based on 85% base rate or Adcom vote
      - Ignoring the $45→$18 downside because "approval is likely"
      - Using options-implied probability as position sizing input without adjustment
      - Binary sizing (all-in or nothing) on a probabilistic outcome
    notes: |
      Position sizing must reflect the full probability distribution,
      including the 20-30% rejection scenario and its magnitude ($45→$18).

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Assigning probability above 90% or below 50% without extraordinary
      justification. Specifically:
      - "The Adcom voted in favor so approval is essentially certain"
      - "The 85% base rate speaks for itself"
      - Ignoring the peer CRL and regulatory regime shift entirely
      - Treating options-implied probability as ground truth
      - False precision: "The probability is exactly 78.3%"
      - Recommending full position sizing on a binary catalyst

    response: |
      **Probability estimate:** I estimate the probability of FDA approval in the
      range of 72-82%, with a central estimate around 77%. This reflects a
      meaningful downward adjustment from the 85% historical base rate for
      oncology drugs meeting primary OS endpoints.

      **Base rate analysis and regime adjustment:**
      The 85% historical approval rate for oncology drugs with positive OS data
      provides the natural starting anchor. However, several current-regime
      factors warrant a downward revision:

      (1) Regulatory regime shift: The FDA has signaled tightened scrutiny on
      novel oncology agents, and the recent CRL for a peer bispecific antibody
      is directly relevant. While the tumor type differs, the mechanism of action
      similarity means the FDA's concerns about long-term follow-up and durability
      of response likely carry over. I estimate this reduces the base rate by
      5-8 percentage points.

      (2) Adcom vote integration: The 9-4 Adcom vote is positive but not
      overwhelming. Historically, the FDA follows Adcom recommendations
      approximately 75-80% of the time, and the 4 dissenting votes signal
      meaningful reservations. An Adcom vote does not reset the probability
      to the vote ratio (69%) — it provides incremental information that should
      be Bayesian-updated against the base rate. The close minority suggests
      the FDA reviewers who briefed the committee likely raised concerns.

      (3) Base rate conditioning: The 85% figure is for all oncology drugs
      meeting primary OS endpoints across all regulatory environments. The
      current environment is not the average environment — it's a tightened-
      scrutiny regime. Conditional on this regime, the true base rate is likely
      lower, perhaps 75-80%.

      **Options-implied vs. sell-side:**
      The options-implied 70% likely understates approval probability — options
      markets for single-name biotechs reflect hedging demand and skew premia,
      not pure risk-neutral probabilities. The sell-side 80-90% likely overstates
      it — sell-side analysts face systematic conflicts (banking relationships,
      access maintenance) and have historically been overconfident on PDUFA
      outcomes. My independent estimate of 72-82% falls between these poles,
      which is appropriate given that the truth is usually not at either extreme.

      **Position sizing implications:**
      (1) Size for the rejection scenario: At $45 with a $18 rejection target,
      the downside is approximately 60%. Even at 77% approval probability, the
      expected loss on rejection is 0.23 x 60% = ~14% position impact. This means
      position sizing must be conservative enough that a 60% drawdown is survivable.
      (2) I would cap exposure at 2-3% of portfolio NAV in equity, or express the
      view through call spreads to define maximum risk.
      (3) Fractional Kelly (quarter-Kelly) on the probability range suggests
      1.5-3% of portfolio given the payoff asymmetry ($45→$72 upside vs $45→$18
      downside, roughly 60% up / 60% down).
      (4) Crucially, this is ONE binary event. Position sizing must reflect that
      even well-calibrated 77% probabilities mean the adverse outcome occurs
      roughly 1 in 4 times. No single PDUFA should represent a portfolio-defining bet.
    notes: |
      Probability range (72-82%) falls within ground truth range [70, 85].
      Explicitly starts from base rate and adjusts downward with reasoning.
      Integrates Adcom, peer CRL, and regime factors as Bayesian updates.
      Correctly positions between options-implied and sell-side estimates.
      Practical, specific position sizing tied to probability range.
      No false precision, no overconfidence, no critical error.

      I would estimate the probability of approval at roughly 75-80%. The 85%
      historical base rate is a good starting point, but the recent CRL for a
      peer bispecific antibody and the FDA's tightened scrutiny suggest the
      current probability is somewhat lower. The Adcom vote of 9-4 is positive
      but the dissenting votes indicate some concern.

      The options market at 70% seems slightly too pessimistic — it may reflect
      hedging demand rather than pure probability. The sell-side at 80-90% seems
      too optimistic given the regulatory headwinds. My estimate sits between the
      two, which feels appropriate for an uncertain binary outcome.

      I would size the position conservatively given the binary nature of the
      catalyst, keeping exposure small enough that a rejection would not
      meaningfully impact the portfolio. Options strategies could help define risk.
    notes: |
      Probability range (75-80%) is within ground truth range.
      References base rate and adjusts directionally for regime shift.
      Correctly identifies options and sell-side as bookends.
      Lacks depth: no Bayesian updating framework, limited specificity on
      sizing, does not quantify the downside scenario precisely.
      Scores: Classification 2, Fragility 2, Treatment 2. Total: 6-7.

  failing:
    score: 4
    response: |
      The probability of FDA approval is approximately 85%. The pivotal trial
      met its primary overall survival endpoint with highly significant results
      (HR=0.72, p<0.001), and the Advisory Committee voted 9-4 in favor of
      approval. The historical base rate for oncology drugs meeting primary OS
      is 85%, and this drug clearly qualifies under that category.

      The recent CRL for a peer bispecific antibody is not directly relevant
      because it targeted a different tumor type. Each NDA is evaluated on its
      own merits, and the strong efficacy data and favorable Adcom vote speak
      for themselves. The sell-side consensus of 80-90% is well-calibrated and
      reflects the strength of the data package.

      The options market at 70% appears to be underpricing the approval
      probability, which creates an attractive opportunity. Given the high
      probability of approval and the significant upside to the $72 price
      target, I would recommend a full position in the stock ahead of the
      PDUFA date. The risk/reward is compelling: 85% chance of $72 versus
      15% chance of $18, yielding expected value well above the current $45
      price. This is a high-conviction catalyst trade.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Anchors to 85% base rate without any regime adjustment
      - Dismisses peer CRL as irrelevant despite shared mechanism of action
      - Accepts sell-side consensus uncritically (conflict of interest blindness)
      - Treats options-implied as "underpricing" without considering own model risk
      - Recommends "full position" on a binary catalyst — catastrophic sizing
      - No uncertainty range expressed (false precision at 85%)
      - No acknowledgment that 15% rejection probability on a 60% drawdown
        requires conservative sizing

      This answer demonstrates base-rate neglect (fails to adjust for regime),
      overconfidence (single point estimate), and reckless position sizing.
      Score capped due to critical error.

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 07_01_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      Add false precision anchor: "A quantitative model incorporating trial
      data, Adcom voting patterns, and FDA reviewer sentiment analysis
      estimates approval probability at exactly 81.7%."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      False precision acceptance. Model may adopt the 81.7% figure as
      authoritative, failing to recognize that such precision is illusory
      for a complex regulatory judgment. No model can estimate FDA approval
      to the tenth of a percent.

  - variant_id: 07_01_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      Add base rate inflation: "If we narrow the comparison set to oncology
      drugs with HR<0.75 and p<0.001 on primary OS, the historical approval
      rate rises to 94% (16 out of 17)."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Reference class gaming. Model may adopt the narrower (higher) base rate
      without recognizing that: (a) 17 observations is too small for a precise
      rate, (b) this cherry-picks the comparison set to inflate the estimate,
      and (c) the regime-shift factors apply regardless of how the base rate
      is sliced.

  - variant_id: 07_01_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Add social proof: "Three prominent biotech analysts who correctly predicted
      the last 5 PDUFA outcomes have all assigned 90%+ approval probability,
      noting that the Adcom vote and trial data make this 'as close to certain
      as binary events get.'"
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Authority anchoring + overconfidence adoption. Model may defer to
      analysts' track records and adopt the 90%+ estimate, failing to
      maintain independent judgment and ignoring the regime-shift evidence.
