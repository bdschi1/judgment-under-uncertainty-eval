# --- SCENARIO ---
title: 12-Month Recession Probability and Healthcare Portfolio Impact
domain: Healthcare Services
relationship_type: regime_dependent

observed_relationship: |
  The 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve has been inverted for 18 months.
  Historically, 6 out of 7 yield curve inversions since 1970 have preceded
  a recession within 24 months, giving a base rate of approximately 86%.
  The consensus among surveyed economists places the 12-month recession
  probability at 35%. The portfolio under management has significant
  exposure to utilization-sensitive hospital operators and outpatient
  service providers whose volumes are correlated with employment and
  insurance coverage.

context: |
  Current macro conditions present mixed signals. Unemployment remains at
  3.8% (historically low), consumer spending is resilient, and the services
  sector continues to expand. However, the ISM Manufacturing PMI has been
  below 50 for 8 consecutive months, corporate earnings revisions are net
  negative, and bank lending standards have tightened meaningfully. The Fed
  has held rates at elevated levels for over a year. Some economists argue
  that quantitative easing and post-COVID fiscal stimulus have distorted
  the yield curve signal, reducing its predictive power in the current cycle.
  Others note that the duration of the inversion (18 months) exceeds most
  historical episodes, which may signal either stronger or weaker
  predictive power depending on the framework used.

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Estimate the probability of a US recession beginning within 12 months,
     expressing a range rather than a point estimate
  2. Reconcile the yield curve signal (86% historical) with the economist
     consensus (35%) and explain which you weight more heavily
  3. Identify the key factors that could cause the yield curve signal to
     fail in this cycle
  4. Assess the portfolio impact under your recession probability estimate
     and recommend positioning adjustments

    correct_answer: regime_dependent
    notes: |
      The yield curve's predictive power is regime-dependent: it has a
      strong historical track record but the current monetary policy regime
      (post-QE, elevated Fed balance sheet) may distort the signal. The
      relationship is not structural (7 observations is too few) and not
      noise (the mechanism is plausible). Economist consensus at 35% may
      reflect recency bias (no recession yet despite long inversion) or
      genuine structural-break reasoning.

      Treating the yield curve as infallible (86% = probability) is base-rate
      misapplication from a tiny sample.
      Dismissing the yield curve entirely because "this time is different"
      is a critical error if done without rigorous reasoning.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - Extremely small sample size (7 inversions, 6 recessions)
      - QE and Fed balance sheet distortion of term premium
      - Post-COVID fiscal stimulus may have altered cycle dynamics
      - Duration of inversion (18 months) is atypical — unclear directional implication
      - Yield curve is a single indicator, not a sufficient statistic
      - Economist consensus may embed different information (labor data, spending)
      - Healthcare-specific factors (ACA, Medicaid expansion) change recession sensitivity
      - Lag variability (6-24 months historically) makes 12-month framing imprecise
    notes: |
      The critical insight is that 7 observations cannot support a precise
      probability estimate. The yield curve provides information, but converting
      6/7 into an 86% probability is a misuse of frequentist statistics on
      a tiny, non-stationary sample.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Stress-test hospital portfolio for volume declines of 5-15%
      - Tilt toward counter-cyclical healthcare (managed care, pharma) vs. cyclical (hospitals)
      - Reduce exposure to utilization-sensitive names with high fixed costs and leverage
      - Maintain positions but add recession hedges (puts on hospital operators, long duration)
      - Monitor leading indicators (initial claims, bank lending) for deterioration
      - Scenario analysis with explicit probability weights rather than single-scenario planning
    invalid_treatments:
      - Ignoring recession risk because unemployment is low
      - Fully de-risking based on yield curve signal alone
      - Using 86% as the portfolio planning probability
      - Treating economist consensus (35%) as correct without independent judgment
    notes: |
      Treatment must reflect genuine uncertainty (neither 86% nor 35% should
      be taken at face value) and focus on portfolio resilience rather than
      binary recession/no-recession positioning.

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Adopting either extreme without nuance. Specifically:
      - "The yield curve has an 86% success rate, so recession is near-certain"
      - "Economists say 35%, the yield curve is distorted, so no meaningful risk"
      - Ignoring the small-N problem with the yield curve entirely
      - False precision: "The probability is exactly 42%"
      - No portfolio impact analysis despite explicit healthcare exposure
      - Recommending dramatic portfolio changes on a single indicator

      **Probability estimate:** I estimate the 12-month recession probability
      in the range of 30-45%, with a central estimate around 38%. This reflects
      meaningful recession risk that exceeds "normal" background rates (~15-20%
      in any given year) but falls well below the raw yield curve signal.

      **Reconciling the yield curve and economist consensus:**
      The yield curve's 6/7 historical track record provides genuine information
      but cannot be mechanically converted to an 86% probability. Seven observations
      drawn from different monetary regimes, fiscal environments, and global
      conditions do not constitute a stable statistical sample. The base rate is
      informative directionally — inversions signal elevated risk — but the precise
      number (86%) carries wide confidence intervals. With a binomial distribution
      and n=7, even assuming true probability of 70%, observing 6 or more "hits"
      is not unlikely. The true signal strength is somewhere between the naive 86%
      and pure chance.

      The economist consensus at 35% may incorporate information the yield curve
      does not: labor market strength, consumer balance sheets, fiscal policy
      offsets. However, consensus economists also exhibit herding behavior and
      have historically been poor at forecasting recessions in real time. The
      consensus may underweight the yield curve signal due to "this time is
      different" reasoning, which has a poor track record of its own.

      I weight neither source as authoritative. Instead, I integrate:
      (1) Yield curve inversion: directionally informative, elevates base probability,
      but magnitude uncertain. Adjusting for QE distortion, I weight this as
      consistent with 50-65% recession probability.
      (2) Economist consensus: 35% likely too low given the yield curve, but
      incorporates valid information about labor market resilience.
      (3) Mixed macro data: Manufacturing contraction vs. services expansion,
      low unemployment vs. tightening lending standards. Net assessment: modestly
      recessionary lean but not decisive.
      (4) Historical lag: 18 months into inversion with typical lag of 6-24 months
      means we are in the higher-risk portion of the historical window.

      Blending these inputs with appropriate uncertainty yields 30-45%.

      **Yield curve failure factors:**
      (1) QE has permanently altered term premia — the curve may be inverted
      due to Fed holdings suppressing long rates, not due to recessionary
      expectations. This is the strongest "structural break" argument.
      (2) Post-COVID fiscal stimulus (infrastructure spending, IRA, CHIPS Act)
      may be providing an economic floor that previous cycles lacked.
      (3) The 18-month duration of inversion is unusual and may indicate the
      curve is reflecting technical factors rather than economic signals.
      (4) Globalization of bond markets means foreign demand for US Treasuries
      can flatten/invert the curve for non-domestic-recession reasons.

      **Portfolio positioning:**
      At 30-45% recession probability, I would not de-risk dramatically but
      would take defensive steps:
      (1) Stress-test hospital operators for 8-12% volume declines — this is
      the realistic recession scenario for utilization-sensitive names.
      (2) Reduce positions in highly leveraged hospital operators (HCA, CHS)
      by 25-30% and redirect toward managed care (UNH, ELV) which benefits
      from lower utilization in a recession.
      (3) Add tail hedges: buy 6-month puts on XLV or specific hospital names,
      funded by selling upside calls to create zero-cost collars.
      (4) Increase cash buffer by 2-3% to provide dry powder if recession
      creates buying opportunities.
      (5) Monitor weekly initial claims, monthly bank lending survey, and ISM
      manufacturing as leading indicators for probability revision.
    notes: |
      Probability range (30-45%) falls within ground truth range [25, 50].
      Explicitly reconciles yield curve and economist consensus with reasoning.
      Addresses small-N problem and QE distortion as key limitations.
      Portfolio treatment is specific, proportional, and tied to the healthcare
      sector. No false precision, no single-indicator dependence.

      I would estimate the 12-month recession probability at around 35-45%. The
      yield curve inversion is a concerning signal with a strong historical track
      record, but the sample size is very small (only 7 inversions) and the current
      monetary policy environment with QE may have distorted the signal.

      The economist consensus at 35% seems reasonable but possibly slightly too
      low given the yield curve and manufacturing weakness. The low unemployment
      rate is reassuring but is often a lagging indicator.

      For the portfolio, the utilization-sensitive hospital stocks are most at risk
      in a recession. I would consider reducing exposure to the most leveraged
      hospital operators and tilting toward more defensive healthcare names like
      managed care or pharma. Adding some hedges would be prudent given the
      uncertainty.
    notes: |
      Probability range (35-45%) is within ground truth range.
      Acknowledges yield curve limitations and small-N problem.
      Directionally correct portfolio recommendations but lacks specificity
      on sizing, hedge structure, and monitoring triggers.
      Scores: Classification 2, Fragility 2, Treatment 2. Total: 6-7.

  failing:
    score: 4
    response: |
      Based on the yield curve inversion, the recession probability is
      approximately 85%. The 2yr/10yr curve has inverted, and historically
      this has preceded a recession 6 out of 7 times, giving a reliable base
      rate of 86%. The current inversion has persisted for 18 months, which
      if anything strengthens the signal by indicating sustained stress in
      fixed income markets.

      The economist consensus of 35% is far too low and reflects complacency.
      Economists have a poor track record of forecasting recessions, and the
      low unemployment rate is a classic lagging indicator that provides false
      comfort. The manufacturing contraction and tightening lending standards
      confirm that recessionary dynamics are already underway.

      Given the near-certainty of recession, I would aggressively de-risk the
      healthcare portfolio. Hospital operators should be sold entirely, as their
      utilization-sensitive business models will face severe volume declines.
      The entire portfolio should be shifted to cash and defensive names like
      pharma and managed care. This is not a time for half-measures — the yield
      curve signal is one of the most reliable leading indicators in
      macroeconomics, and ignoring it would be irresponsible. The 18-month
      inversion duration strongly suggests we are in the final months before
      a downturn begins.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Treats 6/7 as precise 86% probability (sample size blindness)
      - Dismisses economist consensus entirely without balanced analysis
      - Ignores QE distortion and structural-break arguments
      - Converts probability estimate directly into "near-certainty"
      - Recommends "sell entirely" — binary action on probabilistic assessment
      - No uncertainty range — single point estimate of ~85%
      - Overconfident extrapolation of inversion duration significance

      This answer demonstrates base-rate misapplication (tiny N treated as
      precise probability), overconfidence, and binary thinking that converts
      uncertainty into false certainty. The aggressive de-risking recommendation
      is disproportionate even if recession probability were 85%.

adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 07_02_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      Add confirming indicator: "The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index
      (LEI) has declined for 20 consecutive months, which has preceded every
      recession since 1960 with zero false positives."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Indicator stacking without independence assessment. Model may add the
      LEI signal to the yield curve signal, compounding probabilities as if
      the indicators were independent. In reality, the LEI includes the yield
      curve as a component, so this is double-counting.

  - variant_id: 07_02_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      Add "this time is different" framing: "Several prominent economists argue
      that the yield curve has been structurally broken since QE began. The last
      two inversions (2019-2020 and current) may simply reflect term premium
      distortion rather than recessionary expectations."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Overweighting the "broken" narrative. Model may dismiss the yield curve
      entirely based on the structural-break argument, failing to recognize
      that "this time is different" has historically been a dangerous phrase,
      and that the 2019-2020 inversion DID precede a recession (albeit caused
      by COVID, not typical cycle dynamics).

  - variant_id: 07_02_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Add urgency framing: "Your largest hospital operator holding reports
      earnings next week and is trading at 52-week lows. Several sell-side
      analysts have downgraded the sector citing recession fears."
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Action bias under urgency. Model may recommend immediate selling or
      dramatic repositioning based on the near-term earnings catalyst rather
      than the probabilistic recession assessment. The correct approach is
      to separate the recession probability analysis from short-term
      trading decisions.
