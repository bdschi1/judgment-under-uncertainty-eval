# --- SCENARIO ---
title: Earnings Beat/Miss Probability for Large-Cap Pharma
domain: Pharma
relationship_type: coincidental_exploitable

observed_relationship: |
  A large-cap pharma company ($80B market cap) has beaten consensus EPS
  estimates in 14 of the last 16 quarters (88% beat rate), with an average
  beat magnitude of 4.2%. The broader S&P 500 healthcare sector has a
  historical quarterly beat rate of approximately 72%. The company's next
  earnings report is in 3 weeks. Consensus expects $2.85 EPS. However,
  the company faces a major patent cliff on its largest drug (28% of revenue)
  with generic entry expected within 6 months. Management guided $2.80-2.90
  on the last call but noted "increasing headwinds from generic competition
  in the coming quarters."

context: |
  The company's historical beat rate has been driven by conservative guidance
  practices (management consistently sandbags estimates by 3-5%), cost
  discipline, and a diversified portfolio that masks individual product
  underperformance. The patent cliff changes the structural dynamics:
  generic entry will create a step-function revenue decline that cannot be
  offset by the typical earnings management levers (timing of R&D expenses,
  one-time items, share buybacks). Several sell-side analysts have noted
  that the consensus estimates "may not fully reflect the steepness of the
  generic erosion curve." Short interest has increased from 1.2% to 3.1%
  of float over the past quarter.

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Estimate the probability that the company beats consensus EPS of $2.85,
     expressing both a point estimate and a defensible range
  2. Explain whether the historical 88% beat rate is a reliable base rate for
     this quarter, and what adjustments are needed
  3. Identify the key factors that could cause the historical pattern to break
  4. Recommend how to position around the earnings event given your probability
     estimate

  classification:
    weight: 3
    correct_answer: coincidental_exploitable
    notes: |
      The historical beat rate is coincidental-exploitable: driven by management's
      conservative guidance practices (systematic sandbagging) rather than any
      structural superiority. This pattern has been exploitable historically but
      the patent cliff represents a regime change that undermines the mechanism
      (guidance games cannot offset a 28% revenue loss). The beat streak is
      coincidental to the extent that it reflects earnings management rather
      than genuine outperformance.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - Patent cliff creates step-function revenue decline that guidance games cannot mask
      - Historical beat rate driven by sandbagging, not fundamental outperformance
      - Generic entry timing may not align neatly with quarterly estimates
      - Management guidance language ("increasing headwinds") signals less confidence
      - Rising short interest suggests informed investors expect deterioration
      - Consensus may already partially reflect patent cliff concerns
      - 16-quarter history may not be representative of post-cliff earnings dynamics
    notes: |
      The key fragility is that the mechanism driving the beat streak (conservative
      guidance + diversified portfolio) is about to be disrupted by a structural
      change (patent cliff). Past beat rate is not predictive of future beats
      when the underlying earnings generation model is changing.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Reduce expected beat probability relative to historical rate
      - If trading the earnings event, size for the possibility of first miss in years
      - Consider the asymmetric reaction (a miss after 14/16 beats will be punished more severely)
      - Focus on forward guidance quality more than the backward-looking EPS number
      - Use options to express a view on earnings surprise while defining risk
    invalid_treatments:
      - Extrapolating 88% beat rate into this quarter without adjustment
      - Going long purely based on historical beat streak
      - Ignoring the patent cliff as a structural break in earnings dynamics
      - Treating management guidance as face-value reliable when incentives have shifted
    notes: |
      Treatment should reflect that even if a beat occurs this quarter, the
      forward guidance will be critical and may trigger a sell-the-news response.

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Applying the 88% historical beat rate without adjustment for the patent cliff.
      Specifically:
      - "The company has beaten 14/16 quarters, so probability of beating is ~88%"
      - Ignoring the patent cliff as relevant to this quarter's earnings dynamics
      - Treating the beat streak as evidence of persistent fundamental superiority
      - No discussion of how generic entry changes the earnings management equation
      - False precision on beat probability without acknowledging regime change

      Probability estimate: I estimate a 60-72% probability of beating the
      $2.85 consensus, with a central estimate around 65%. This represents a
      significant downward adjustment from the company's 88% historical beat rate.

      Base rate adjustment: The 88% historical beat rate reflects a specific
      mechanism — management's conservative guidance practices combined with a
      diversified revenue base that provides multiple levers for managing quarterly
      results. However, this quarter represents a potential inflection point:

      (1) The patent cliff on the largest drug (28% of revenue) changes the earnings
      equation fundamentally. Generic entry creates a revenue decline that cannot be
      offset by the usual levers (timing R&D expenses, buyback accretion, one-time
      items). The scale of the cliff likely exceeds the typical 3-5% guidance buffer.

      (2) Management's language ("increasing headwinds from generic competition")
      represents a subtle but meaningful shift from their typical conservative-but-
      optimistic tone. This suggests even management is less confident in their ability
      to deliver the usual beat.

      (3) The broader healthcare beat rate of 72% provides a more conservative baseline,
      but even this may overstate the probability for a company approaching a structural
      revenue decline.

      (4) Rising short interest (1.2% to 3.1%) indicates informed market participants
      are positioning for deterioration. While short interest alone is not predictive,
      the magnitude of the increase is notable.

      I adjust the probability down from 88% to 60-72% based on: patent cliff impact
      (-10 to -15 pp), management signal weakening (-3 to -5 pp), consensus potentially
      already adjusted (-2 to -5 pp partially offsetting, since lower consensus is
      easier to beat).

      Positioning: Even at 65% beat probability, I would not go long into earnings
      because (1) the asymmetric price reaction to a miss after a long beat streak will
      be severe (downside of 8-12% on a miss vs upside of 2-3% on a modest beat), and
      (2) forward guidance will likely be the dominant driver, and patent cliff guidance
      is likely to disappoint regardless of the backward-looking EPS number. If expressing
      a view, I would use options with defined risk — perhaps a straddle if the implied
      move underestimates the potential for a guidance-driven selloff even on an EPS beat.
    notes: |
      Probability range (60-72%) falls within ground truth range [65, 80].
      Explicitly adjusts from historical beat rate with specific reasoning.
      Identifies patent cliff as mechanism that disrupts the beat streak driver.
      Sophisticated positioning that accounts for asymmetric reactions.

  acceptable:
    score: 7
    response: |
      I would estimate a 65-75% probability of beating the $2.85 consensus.
      While the company has an impressive 88% beat rate, the approaching patent
      cliff is a meaningful headwind that likely reduces the probability. The
      historical beat rate was driven partly by conservative guidance practices,
      and the generic entry may overwhelm those management levers.

      The rising short interest and management's cautious language both suggest
      the earnings dynamics are shifting. I would not extrapolate the 88% rate
      into this quarter without meaningful adjustment.

      For positioning, I would be cautious about going long into earnings given
      that even a beat may be followed by disappointing forward guidance related
      to the patent cliff.
    notes: |
      Probability range (65-75%) overlaps ground truth range.
      Recognizes patent cliff as disruption to historical pattern.
      Directionally correct but lacks quantitative adjustment framework.

  failing:
    score: 4
    response: |
      Based on the company's track record, I estimate an 85% probability of
      beating the $2.85 consensus. The company has beaten in 14 of the last
      16 quarters, demonstrating consistent execution and conservative guidance
      practices. This is a management team that knows how to deliver.

      The patent cliff is a longer-term concern but should not materially impact
      this quarter's results, as generic entry is still 6 months away. Management
      guided $2.80-2.90, and given their history of sandbags, the actual number
      is likely above the range midpoint. The rising short interest may actually
      create fuel for a short squeeze on a beat.

      I would recommend going long into earnings to capture the expected beat
      and potential short squeeze. The 88% historical beat rate gives high
      confidence in this trade.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Applies historical beat rate nearly unchanged (85% vs 88%)
      - Dismisses patent cliff as not relevant to this quarter
      - Extrapolates guidance sandbagging without considering structural change
      - Uses short interest as bullish catalyst rather than warning signal
      - No uncertainty range — single point estimate
      - No discussion of asymmetric earnings reactions

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 07_03_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      A respected sell-side analyst known for pharma earnings accuracy has
      published an above-consensus estimate of $2.92, citing channel checks
      showing stronger-than-expected demand for the company's oncology
      portfolio, which should more than offset early generic erosion.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Authority anchoring. Model may adopt the above-consensus estimate as
      more reliable, inflating the beat probability without independently
      assessing whether oncology strength can truly offset a 28% revenue
      patent cliff.

  - variant_id: 07_03_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      The company has historically beaten in Q4 (the upcoming quarter) 100%
      of the time over the last 6 years, as year-end cost management and
      inventory builds by distributors create a seasonal tailwind.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Reference class narrowing. Model may use the 100% Q4 beat rate instead
      of the 88% overall rate, ignoring that the patent cliff represents a
      structural break that seasonal patterns cannot overcome.

  - variant_id: 07_03_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Options markets are pricing a 5% expected move on earnings, which is
      below the stock's average 6.8% post-earnings move over the last 2 years.
      This suggests the market is complacent about earnings risk.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Market signal misinterpretation. Model may conclude that low implied
      volatility means the market expects a beat, rather than recognizing
      that implied volatility reflects hedging supply and demand, not
      directional probability.
