# --- SCENARIO ---
title: MedTech Merger Completion Probability
domain: MedTech
relationship_type: regime_dependent

observed_relationship: |
  A large-cap medtech company ($45B market cap) has announced acquisition of
  a mid-cap competitor ($12B deal value) at a 35% premium. The deal requires
  FTC review under Hart-Scott-Rodino. The combined entity would control
  approximately 40% of the US surgical robotics market. Historical merger
  completion rates for announced healthcare deals above $5B are approximately
  85%. However, the current FTC has adopted a significantly more aggressive
  posture on horizontal healthcare mergers, challenging 3 of the last 5
  large healthcare deals compared to a historical challenge rate of roughly
  15%. The merger spread (difference between current price and deal price)
  implies approximately 65% completion probability.

context: |
  The FTC has publicly stated its intent to scrutinize healthcare consolidation
  more aggressively, citing concerns about price increases and reduced
  innovation in concentrated markets. The acquiring company's CEO has stated
  the deal is "essential for innovation" and that the companies "serve
  different clinical segments despite apparent market overlap." Two prominent
  antitrust law firms have published contradictory analyses: one estimates
  70%+ completion probability citing narrow product market definitions, the
  other estimates under 50% citing the FTC's recent track record. The target
  company's stock is trading at a 12% discount to the deal price, reflecting
  the market's assessment of completion risk.

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Estimate the probability of deal completion, expressing both a point
     estimate and a defensible range
  2. Explain how you weight the historical base rate (85%) versus the current
     regulatory regime (3/5 challenged recently) in your estimate
  3. Assess whether the merger spread (65% implied probability) reflects fair
     value or a mispricing
  4. Recommend a risk-arbitrage position sizing framework given the binary
     payoff structure

grading_axes:
  classification:
    weight: 3
    correct_answer: regime_dependent
    notes: |
      Merger completion probability is regime-dependent: the 85% historical
      base rate reflects a different FTC posture. The current regulatory
      regime (aggressive FTC, 3/5 recent challenges) materially changes the
      conditional probability. The relationship is not structural (FTC posture
      changes with administration) and not noise (the mechanism — antitrust
      enforcement — is real and observable).

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - FTC posture is administration-dependent (regime-dependent)
      - 40% market share is a red flag under any antitrust framework
      - Historical base rate (85%) reflects pre-current-FTC environment
      - Recent 3/5 challenge rate is small-N and may overstate aggressiveness
      - Merger spread reflects risk premia beyond pure probability (capital opportunity cost)
      - Antitrust law firm analyses disagree, reflecting genuine legal uncertainty
      - Remedy possibilities (divestitures) could allow modified completion
      - Political and policy environment may shift before deal resolution
    notes: |
      Both the historical 85% rate and the recent 3/5 challenge rate are
      drawn from small samples in different regimes. Neither should be
      taken at face value. The 40% market share is a strong negative signal
      regardless of regime.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Size merger arb position for worst-case scenario (deal breaks, target drops 25-30%)
      - Use collar structure (long target, short acquirer) to isolate merger spread
      - Account for time value of capital tied up in merger arb
      - Consider probability of modified deal (divestitures required) vs clean completion vs break
      - Set explicit stop-loss if merger spread widens beyond a threshold
    invalid_treatments:
      - Full position based on historical 85% completion rate
      - Treating merger spread as "free money" without sizing for deal break risk
      - Ignoring the FTC regime shift in position sizing
      - Binary positioning (all-in on completion or full short on break)
    notes: |
      Risk-arbitrage sizing must account for: probability of completion,
      magnitude of loss on break, time to resolution, and capital opportunity cost.

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Applying the historical 85% completion rate without regime adjustment.
      Specifically:
      - "85% of healthcare deals complete, so this one likely will too"
      - Ignoring the FTC's stated intent to scrutinize healthcare consolidation
      - Treating the merger spread as a mispricing without independent probability estimate
      - No discussion of the 40% market share as an antitrust red flag
      - False precision on completion probability without regime analysis

    score: 11
    response: |
      Probability estimate: I estimate deal completion probability in the range
      of 55-70%, with a central estimate around 62%. This reflects a substantial
      downward adjustment from the historical 85% base rate for large healthcare
      mergers.

      Base rate vs regime analysis: The 85% historical completion rate is the wrong
      base rate for this deal. The relevant conditional probability is: "What is
      the completion rate for large healthcare mergers with significant market
      overlap under the current FTC regime?" The answer is much lower than 85%.

      Adjustments from the unconditional base rate: (1) FTC regime shift: The current
      FTC has challenged 3 of 5 recent large healthcare deals, a dramatic departure
      from the ~15% historical challenge rate. While 5 observations is a tiny sample,
      the shift reflects a stated policy change, not random variation. I estimate
      this reduces the base completion probability by 15-25 percentage points.
      (2) Market concentration: 40% combined market share in surgical robotics is a
      red flag under any antitrust framework. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index will
      show a highly concentrated market. This is precisely the type of horizontal
      merger the current FTC has targeted. (3) Remedy possibility: Not all challenges
      result in deal breaks. The FTC may require divestitures that allow a modified
      deal to proceed. I assign roughly 15% probability to "completion with significant
      divestitures" and 47% to "clean completion," yielding ~62% total completion.
      (4) The recent 3/5 challenge rate (60%) likely overstates the FTC's success rate
      on deals it challenges, as some challenges are resolved through settlements.

      Merger spread assessment: The spread-implied 65% completion probability is
      roughly fair given my independent estimate of 55-70%. However, merger spreads
      incorporate a risk premium beyond pure probability — they must compensate for
      capital opportunity cost, binary outcome risk, and time to resolution. The
      "fair" spread for a 62% probability deal would actually imply a lower market
      price than a naive 62% would suggest. This means the spread-implied 65% is
      actually reflecting a slightly higher risk-neutral probability, perhaps 68-72%.

      Position sizing: Using a fractional Kelly framework with my probability range:
      Completion upside: ~12% (spread capture). Break downside: ~25-30% (premium
      unwind). At 62% completion, the Kelly fraction is approximately (0.62 x 12% -
      0.38 x 27%) / 12% = ~6% of capital. Quarter-Kelly (conservative) suggests
      1.5% of portfolio. I would express through long target / short acquirer pairs
      to isolate the merger spread from broader market moves, with a hard stop if the
      spread widens past 20% (implying sub-50% completion).
    notes: |
      Probability range (55-70%) falls within ground truth range [55, 75].
      Distinguishes between unconditional and regime-conditional base rates.
      Accounts for divestitures as intermediate outcome. Sophisticated merger
      arb sizing with Kelly framework and stop-loss discipline.

  acceptable:
    score: 7
    response: |
      I estimate the deal completion probability at around 60-70%. The historical
      85% rate is misleading because the current FTC is significantly more aggressive
      on healthcare mergers. The 40% market share is a clear antitrust concern, and
      the FTC has challenged 3 of the last 5 large healthcare deals.

      The merger spread at 65% implied seems roughly fair, though it may slightly
      understate the risk given the FTC's stated intent. The contradictory analyses
      from antitrust law firms reflect genuine uncertainty about the outcome.

      I would size a merger arb position conservatively, keeping the position small
      enough that a deal break would not materially impact the portfolio. Using a
      long target / short acquirer pair would help isolate the spread.
    notes: |
      Probability range (60-70%) overlaps ground truth range.
      Identifies regime shift and market concentration as key factors.
      Directionally correct but lacks quantitative rigor on sizing and
      Kelly framework.

  failing:
    score: 4
    response: |
      The deal completion probability is approximately 80%. Healthcare mergers
      of this size have an 85% historical completion rate, and this deal has
      strong strategic rationale. The companies serve "different clinical segments"
      as the CEO noted, which should satisfy the FTC's product market definition.

      The merger spread at 65% implied represents a clear mispricing — the market
      is overstating the antitrust risk. The FTC's recent aggressive posture is
      political and will moderate. This spread offers an attractive risk-adjusted
      return.

      I would recommend a significant merger arb position to capture the spread
      before it narrows. The 85% historical completion rate and strong strategic
      rationale support a high-conviction position.
    notes: |
      CRITICAL ERROR COMMITTED:
      - Applies historical 85% rate without regime adjustment
      - Accepts CEO's market definition framing uncritically
      - Dismisses FTC regime shift as merely political
      - Calls merger spread a "clear mispricing" without independent analysis
      - Recommends significant position without sizing for deal break scenario
      - No uncertainty range expressed

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 07_04_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      The acquiring company has retained the antitrust law firm that successfully
      defended the last two approved large healthcare mergers. Their internal
      analysis reportedly assigns 85%+ completion probability based on narrow
      product market definitions.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Authority anchoring with conflict of interest blindness. The retained
      firm has an obvious financial incentive to be optimistic. Model may
      defer to their analysis without recognizing the conflict.

  - variant_id: 07_04_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      A recent Wall Street Journal article reports that FTC staff have
      informally indicated they are "unlikely to challenge" the deal, citing
      sources familiar with the review process.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Anchoring on unverified information. Leaked FTC staff opinions are
      unreliable — the Commission votes as a body and staff recommendations
      are not binding. Model may dramatically increase completion probability
      based on a single unverified report.

  - variant_id: 07_04_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      If the deal breaks, the target company trades back to $32 (pre-announcement
      price of $36 minus a "stigma discount" for being an acquisition target
      that failed). This implies a deal-break loss of approximately 35%.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Loss aversion affecting probability estimate. The large downside
      magnitude may cause the model to either overstate completion probability
      (motivated reasoning to justify the position) or refuse to take any
      position despite positive expected value.
