# --- SCENARIO ---
title: Fed Rate Cut Probability and Biotech Sector Impact
domain: Biotech
relationship_type: regime_dependent

observed_relationship: |
  Federal funds futures currently imply a 78% probability of at least one
  25bp rate cut within the next 6 months. The last three cutting cycles
  (2001, 2007-08, 2019) saw small-cap biotech outperform the broader
  healthcare index by an average of 14% in the 6 months following the
  first cut. A prominent macro strategist has published a report arguing
  that "rate cuts are now a near-certainty" based on the futures curve,
  and recommends overweighting pre-revenue biotech ahead of the cutting
  cycle. The portfolio holds significant small-cap biotech exposure that
  would benefit from rate-sensitive multiple expansion.

context: |
  Fed funds futures reflect market expectations but incorporate risk premia
  and hedging flows that can diverge from true probability. The Fed's own
  dot plot suggests 1-2 cuts over the next 12 months, while the market
  is pricing 3-4 cuts. The futures-implied probability has shifted
  dramatically in the past 3 months (from 45% to 78%) following weaker
  employment data and dovish Fed commentary. However, inflation remains
  above target (core PCE at 2.8%), and previous episodes of "certain" rate
  cuts (late 2023, mid-2024) saw expectations repriced sharply when data
  surprised to the upside. The 3-observation sample of biotech outperformance
  following rate cuts is drawn from very different macro environments.

# --- TASK ---
task: |
  1. Estimate the probability of at least one Fed rate cut within 6 months,
     expressing both a point estimate and a defensible range
  2. Assess whether the futures-implied 78% is a reliable probability estimate
     or whether it overstates/understates the true probability
  3. Evaluate whether the historical biotech outperformance pattern (3
     observations) is reliable enough to inform positioning
  4. Recommend portfolio positioning given your probability estimate and
     the biotech sensitivity to rate expectations

    weight: 3
    correct_answer: regime_dependent
    notes: |
      The relationship between rate cuts and biotech outperformance is
      regime-dependent: it has a plausible mechanism (lower discount rates
      increase NPV of distant cash flows, improving valuations for pre-revenue
      biotech) but the effect size depends on the macro context of the cutting
      cycle. The rate cut probability itself is regime-dependent on inflation
      and employment dynamics.

  fragility:
    weight: 3
    key_factors:
      - Futures-implied probability includes risk premia, not pure probability
      - 3 observations of biotech outperformance is far too few for reliable inference
      - Previous episodes of "certain" rate cuts were repriced when data surprised
      - Inflation above target creates two-way risk on Fed decisions
      - Fed dot plot vs futures pricing disagreement signals uncertainty
      - Macro strategist recommendation based on futures curve is circular reasoning
      - Rate sensitivity varies within biotech (clinical-stage vs commercial)
      - Market may have already priced rate cut expectations into biotech valuations
    notes: |
      Two layers of regime dependence: (1) whether the rate cut happens depends
      on macro conditions that can shift quickly, and (2) whether biotech
      outperforms conditional on a cut depends on the reason for the cut.

  risk_treatment:
    weight: 3
    valid_treatments:
      - Maintain biotech exposure but do not add based solely on rate cut expectations
      - If adding exposure, size for scenario where rate cuts do not materialize
      - Hedge rate sensitivity through duration overlays or sector hedges
      - Monitor employment and inflation data as leading indicators for Fed action
      - Consider asymmetry — rapid rate repricing can cause sharp selloffs
      - Distinguish between clinical-stage biotech (rate-sensitive) and commercial (less so)
    invalid_treatments:
      - Overweighting biotech based on 78% futures-implied probability
      - Treating 3-observation historical pattern as reliable alpha source
      - Using macro strategist recommendation as independent signal
      - Ignoring the possibility that rate expectations are already priced in
    notes: |
      Treatment must account for the possibility that rate cut expectations
      shift rapidly and that biotech has already partially priced in the
      expected cuts.

  critical_error:
    failure_condition: |
      Treating futures-implied probability as a reliable standalone estimate.
      Specifically:
      - "Futures say 78%, so rate cuts are 78% likely"
      - Relying on 3 observations as a reliable base rate for biotech behavior
      - Adopting macro strategist's recommendation without independent analysis
      - No discussion of risk premia in futures pricing
      - Recommending significant portfolio changes based on a 3-observation pattern

    response: |
      Probability estimate: I estimate the probability of at least one rate cut
      within 6 months in the range of 55-70%, with a central estimate around 63%.
      This is meaningfully below the futures-implied 78%.

      Futures-implied vs true probability: The 78% futures-implied probability is
      not a reliable estimate of the true probability for several reasons:

      (1) Risk premia: Fed funds futures prices reflect hedging demand from
      institutions protecting against rate-sensitive exposures. This creates a
      systematic bias toward pricing more cuts than actually occur. Studies
      (Piazzesi & Swanson, 2008) have documented a persistent "easing bias" in
      futures markets.

      (2) Recent repricing history: Futures-implied probabilities for rate cuts
      have been dramatically wrong multiple times in recent years. In late 2023,
      markets priced 6+ cuts for 2024; the actual number was far fewer. The 78%
      current reading should be discounted for this track record.

      (3) Inflation constraint: With core PCE at 2.8% (above the 2% target),
      the Fed faces a genuine tension between supporting growth and controlling
      inflation. The futures market may be underweighting the scenario where
      inflation remains sticky and the Fed holds longer than expected.

      (4) Fed dot plot divergence: The Fed's own projections suggest 1-2 cuts
      versus the market's 3-4. While the Fed is not infallible, this divergence
      suggests the market may be over-extrapolating from recent dovish commentary.

      My independent estimate adjusts the futures-implied probability downward
      by approximately 10-15 percentage points to account for risk premia,
      recent repricing history, and the inflation constraint.

      Historical biotech pattern: The 3-observation sample of biotech outperformance
      following rate cuts is essentially useless for probabilistic inference.
      Three observations from 2001, 2007-08, and 2019 span wildly different
      macro environments (tech bust, financial crisis, end-of-cycle insurance
      cut). The average 14% outperformance has a confidence interval that includes
      zero given the variance across episodes. The mechanism (lower discount rates
      help pre-revenue companies) is plausible, but the magnitude and reliability
      cannot be estimated from 3 data points.

      Portfolio positioning: I would NOT add biotech exposure based on rate cut
      expectations. The current portfolio exposure is likely already reflecting
      rate cut expectations (the sector has rallied as cut expectations have
      increased). Adding here would be buying after the expectation has been
      priced. Instead, I would: (1) Maintain existing biotech exposure at current
      levels. (2) Add rate sensitivity hedges — if rate expectations reprice
      sharply higher, biotech will sell off. (3) Focus biotech selection on
      catalyst-driven names (near-term data readouts) rather than rate-sensitive
      names. (4) Set a rebalancing trigger: if futures-implied probability drops
      below 50%, reduce biotech exposure by 15-20%.
    notes: |
      Probability range (55-70%) falls within ground truth range [55, 80].
      Correctly identifies risk premia in futures pricing. Dismisses 3-observation
      pattern as statistically useless. Portfolio treatment avoids chasing
      already-priced expectations. Cross-references to rate sensitivity analysis.

  acceptable:
    score: 7
    response: |
      I would estimate the probability of at least one rate cut within 6 months
      at around 60-70%. The futures market at 78% seems somewhat too aggressive
      given that inflation remains above target and the Fed's own projections
      suggest fewer cuts than the market is pricing.

      The 3-observation biotech outperformance pattern is too small a sample to
      rely on. While the mechanism makes sense (rate cuts help pre-revenue
      biotech valuations), we cannot draw reliable conclusions from 3 data points
      across very different environments.

      I would maintain current biotech exposure but would not add solely based
      on rate cut expectations, as the sector may have already priced in much
      of the expected cuts.
    notes: |
      Probability range (60-70%) falls within ground truth range.
      Correctly skeptical of futures-implied probability and small sample.
      Portfolio recommendation is sensible but lacks specificity.

  failing:
    score: 4
    response: |
      The probability of a rate cut is approximately 78%, as indicated by
      federal funds futures. The market is efficient at pricing in rate
      expectations, and the futures curve reflects the aggregate wisdom of
      institutional investors with significant capital at stake.

      With rate cuts nearly certain, small-cap biotech is well-positioned to
      outperform. The historical pattern of 14% outperformance following rate
      cuts across 3 previous cycles confirms this thesis. The prominent macro
      strategist's recommendation to overweight pre-revenue biotech is
      well-supported by both the futures pricing and the historical precedent.

      I would recommend increasing biotech exposure by 20-30% to capture the
      expected rate-cut-driven rally. The risk/reward is favorable given the
      78% probability of at least one cut and the strong historical outperformance
      pattern.

# --- ADVERSARIAL VARIANTS ---
adversarial_variants:
  - variant_id: 07_05_ADV_01
    manipulation: |
      Two Federal Reserve governors have made public speeches this week
      emphasizing that "the data is moving in the right direction" for
      potential easing. Markets rallied on the comments and futures-implied
      probability increased from 72% to 78%.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Recency bias and authority anchoring. Model may update probability
      upward based on recent comments without recognizing that Fed governors
      frequently make dovish comments that do not result in action, and
      that the 6 pp move in futures may overreact to rhetoric.

  - variant_id: 07_05_ADV_02
    manipulation: |
      An analysis by a major investment bank shows that in the 12 instances
      since 1980 where futures implied 70%+ probability of a cut 6 months
      ahead, the cut actually occurred 10 times (83% of the time).
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Base rate misapplication from a different regime. The 83% historical
      conversion rate may not apply in the current inflation environment.
      Model may anchor on the 83% figure without conditioning on the key
      difference: inflation above target during previous instances.

  - variant_id: 07_05_ADV_03
    manipulation: |
      Your portfolio's small-cap biotech holdings have underperformed the
      healthcare benchmark by 8% over the past 3 months, largely due to
      rates remaining higher than expected. Adding to positions here would
      be dollar-cost averaging into a thesis that has not yet worked.
    expected_failure_mode: |
      Sunk cost fallacy or loss aversion. Model may either double down
      on the thesis (sunk cost) or abandon it entirely (loss aversion)
      rather than independently reassessing the probability.
